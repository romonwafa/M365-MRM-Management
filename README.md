# M365-MRM-Management
View and manage MRM archiving policies for your M365 tenants

## Why
This tool is useful for MSP tentant admins who frequently need to view or manage archival/MRM policies for their clients. I found using the M365 admin portals can be clunky and time consuming. I also found it to be buggy, as sometimes policies would need to be removed and reapplied in order for the MRM policies to kick into effect. This tool simplifies the process and cuts down on unnecessary time wasted.

## Usage
Simply download the powershell script and run with powershell. This is a straightforward menu-based program.
